# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
I want to share my project of data science...this project is related to Exploratory Data Science(EDA) and faeture engineering of the google play store datasets.

I want to share my question about this project...Today 1.85 Million different Apps are available for users to download. Android users have even more from which to choose, with 2.56 Million available through the google play store. These apps have come to play a huge role in the way we live our lives today. Our objective is to find the most popular category. find the App with the large number of installs , the app with the largest size etc. and also we collect the data from this problem. the data consists of 20 columns and 10841 rows.
